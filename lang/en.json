    "footer_description": "Netverse Intelligence focuses on developing adaptive robotics and embodied AI solutions through innovative technologies like a split brain-cerebellum architecture, which decouples multimodal large models (for high-level decision-making) from real-time motion control systems. By prioritizing cost-effective hardware (90% cheaper than traditional solutions) and phased commercialization (from components to full industry solutions), Netverse targets industrial automation upgrades (e.g., manufacturing, logistics) and trillion-dollar general service markets (e.g., healthcare, retail). Their core value lies in accelerating embodied AI adoption by balancing short-term ROI (e.g., 8-month payback) with long-term ecosystem barriers (e.g., developer communities, multi-robot collaboration systems).",
